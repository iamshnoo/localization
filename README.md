# Localization Problem in Robotics : 2D Histogram Filter
[![Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](http://tugan0329.bitbucket.io/imgs/github/cvnd.svg)](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)<br/>

- 2D Histogram Filter
- Python 3
- helpers.py, localizer.py and simulate.py are provided as an existing code base
- a new feature for sensing the 2D environment is added in localizer.py
- an existing bug in the function for move is detected in localizer.py
- the bug is corrected after testing it thoroughly via a well-defined test case
- user description of error is converted to bug testing and correction <br/>

A similar histogram-filter based approach would look something like the following graph.
